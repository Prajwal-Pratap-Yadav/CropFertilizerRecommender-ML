# Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project leverages machine learning to recommend optimal crops and fertilizers based on soil characteristics, weather conditions, and other environmental factors. It aims to enhance agricultural productivity while promoting sustainable farming practices.

## Key Features
- **Crop Recommendation**: Identifies the most suitable crops for a given location.
- **Fertilizer Recommendation**: Suggests the best fertilizers to optimize yield.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Empowers farmers and planners with actionable recommendations based on data analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Frameworks and Libraries:**
  - scikit-learn
  - pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
- **Machine Learning Techniques:** Classification and regression models
- **Datasets:** Publicly available agricultural datasets
